* db models

so we have 3 tables
Cart, Orders, CartItems

The user places items in a Cart in the newest cart for the customer, for each Item a cartitem is created
when user presses cart, retrieve max cart_id for the user
cart_id, customer_id
user will adjust cart as necessary

Checksout
upon a successful checkout, the qty will be updated in the products db
an order is created and a new cart is created for the customer

each record in the OrderItems will pertain to a single item with a set qty
they are tied to the order_id and has the customer_id for reference
so it will look like:
order_item_id, order_id, customer_id, status, product_id, qty

once all orderitems are status'd as fulfilled it will set the order to fulfilled
